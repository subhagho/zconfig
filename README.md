## IDE setup

This library makes use of [Lambok](https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok) for doing away with the need of explicitly writing Getters/Setters.

However, this needs the IDE to be setup properly.

Please refer to [this](https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide) to learn how to configure
your IDE (IntelliJ/eclipse) so that it starts honouring the Lambok annotations
and does annotation processing.
